/* after some frustration of finding the old SAS results and corresponding SAS codes, I'd like have the SAS header as below,

%let curent       = %sysfunc(date(),yymmdd6.) ;
%let curentDat    = 20%sysfunc(date(),yymmdd6.) ;

/* ----------------- Define the output folder according to current date for version contral ---------------- */

%let outPath      = your_project_folder_path ; *<--- which not include the final folder whose names may vary by dates;
%let outFolder    = &curentDat.-your_final_folder_name ; 
                    *^--- the &curentDat. is used in front for better ordering, and the final_folder_name will be the folder name defined by user;
