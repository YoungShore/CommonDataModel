------ Notes for Codes ------

 1. if code packages like 'LAB_OVERALL_', it's aiming cleaning specific characteristic (like lab unit or specimen source) all together from different sources. it sounds impossible, that's why this list will never 'complete' but growing.
 2. if code packages like "LAB_XXX_CLEAN", it's aiming cleaning a particular lab items, like A1C or DAS28 etc, may or may not from different data sources. it won't be a 'complete' list either, but will be realtively steady and growing slowly.
